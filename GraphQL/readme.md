# What is GraphQL?

- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) is a powerfull query language.

- Allows for a more flexible & efficient approach than rest.

- According to the  [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) official documentation :-

` "GraphQL is a query language for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn't tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data."`
